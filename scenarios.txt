1. Cut In Scenario:
	a: A random not platoon able vehicle cuts in between the leader and Follower 1
		--> Follower 1 has to switch to the ACC Controller and create the correct distance
			structural adaptation
		--> Follower 2 has to change the Leader Status and preserve the distance to Follower 1
			adaptation dependent on the deceleration values ( see scenario 4 - 6)
	b: A random platoon able vehicle cuts in between the leader and Follower 1
		--> The random vehicle becomes the new Follower 1 (will be named Follower 3 for easier implementation)
			dependent on the distance value -> structural adaptation (to breaking controller) or no adaptation
		--> The previous Follower 1 has to create the correct distance to the front vehicle
		
2. Communication Errors:
	a: Certain information from the front or leading vehicle are not received
		--> Swap to a fitting controller
		speed, acceleration
			structural adaptation
		
3. The Leading vehicles drives faster than allowed
	a: Follower 1 has to make sure it obeys the speed limit, will become the new leader
		--> Follower 1 swaps to the speed controller
			context adaptation
		--> Follower 2 has to change its leading vehicle
			no adaptation
		
4. The Leading vehicles reduces its speed:
	a: Follower 1 and 2 have to adapts the distance and reduce their own speed
		no adaptation
	
5. The Leading vehicles brakes harder than set for a platoon:
	a: Both follower have to adapt their controller to make sure they can preserve the ideal distance
		structural adaptation
	
6. The Leading vehicle performs an emergency brake:
	a: Both follower have to swap their current controller to an emergency braking controller to avoid an accident
		structural adaptation

	Context adaptation (5, 6)
